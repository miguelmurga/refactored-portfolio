# vulnerability-fixed-portfolio
This repository is the public version of my portfolio built with Nuxt 3, highlighting my skills and projects. It features reusable Vue components for interactivity, multi-language support for accessibility, and dedicated pages for my work and contact info. This version aims to transparently showcase my efforts while addressing vulnerabilities.
