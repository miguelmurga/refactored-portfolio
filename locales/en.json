Second, train your employees to recognize phishing attempts through regular security awareness programs. Third, implement DMARC, SPF, and DKIM to verify email authenticity. Finally, use browser plugins that can detect phishing sites and consider deploying a secure email gateway with URL rewriting capabilities.",
    "llm": "The main differences between GPT-4 and previous versions are significantly improved reasoning capabilities, broader general knowledge, and better understanding of context. GPT-4 shows enhanced capabilities in creative writing, technical problem-solving, and handling complex instructions. It also demonstrates better accuracy and reduced hallucinations compared to GPT-3.5. The model has a context window of up to 32k tokens, allowing it to process much longer documents and conversations.",
